Solar Tracking System

This project presents a Solar Tracking System designed to improve the efficiency of solar energy collection by automatically adjusting the position of a solar panel to follow the sun’s movement throughout the day. Unlike fixed solar panels, the tracking system ensures that the panel always faces the sun, maximizing sunlight exposure.

The system uses sensors and a microcontroller to detect the direction of maximum sunlight and rotate the solar panel accordingly. By continuously aligning the panel with the sun, the system increases power output and overall energy efficiency. The design is simple, cost-effective, and suitable for small-scale solar applications.

This project demonstrates the practical use of embedded systems and renewable energy technology, highlighting how automation can enhance sustainable power generation.
